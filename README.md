## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm (for frontend)  
- Python 3.8+ & pip (for backend)  

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Create a .env file in the backend directory to store environment variables:
   ```bash
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
    ALGORITHM=HS256
    EXPIRATION_MINUTES=60
5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
6. The API will be available at:
http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
4. The React Frontend will be available at:
http://localhost:3000

### Additional notes: You will probably need to also modify frontend/src/config.js, to set the 
     API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
and to also modify the cookie settings in the auth.py file because the code is setup for deployment right now.
